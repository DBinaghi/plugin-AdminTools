# Admin Tools

## Description

Plugin for Omeka Classic. Reunites several minor plugins and code snippets to give site administrators extra tools:

- **Site Under Maintenance**: blocks out from Public interface not-logged in users (and also from Admin interface some logged-in users), displaying instead an "Under Maintenance" sign (note: if wanting to customize sign, one can edit the style section in *views/shared/maintenance/maintenance.php* file).
- **User Manual**: allows for a User Manual (or other document) to be made available for logged-in users.
- **Cookie Bar**: adds to Public interface a header or footer bar with simple information about cookies and privacy policy via the jQuery cookiebar widget.
- **Limit Visibility to Own**: limits Item/Collection/Exhibit visibility to only the ones created by the user (Admin interface).
- **Public Edit Link**: adds a edit link to Items/Collections/Exhibits/Files/Simple Pages to Public interface for logged-in users.
- **Database Backup**: creates a backup copy of the Omeka database, storing it locally (in Omeka's **files** directory) and also making it available for download.
- **Sessions Table**: allows trimming of the Omeka table recording sessions, in case automatic trimming was not effectively working.
- **Tags Table**: allows deleting all unused tags (i.e. tags not associated with any record).

When installed, the plugin creates an **Admin Tools** page accessible to Super User from the admin navigation sidebar; through the page one can put the website in maintenance mode, clear the languages cache and create a backup copy of Omeka's database. The plugin's configuration page lets fine tune this functions, plus many other ones.


## Installation
